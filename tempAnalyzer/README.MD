# Temperature Analyzer

This is a temperature analyzer program developed in C. It's a simple program that allows you to input and store high temperature value and low temperature value for days 1-3. At the program should prompt the user the mean temperature for days 1-3.

# Rules of the application

1. Temperature ranges must fall between -40 to 40, ELSE the program will prompt you to re-enter high and low temperatures for that day
2. High Temperature must be GREATER than Low Temperature, ELSE the program will prompt you to re-enter high and low temperatures for that day

# Contributing

It's a redo of an assignment given to me in my introductory to c programming course. I wanted to challenge myself if I could make the program in a short amount of time.

Feel Free to use and update my version in any way you like. I found that it was a great way to work on routine calculations and use loops and if-statements to make decisions whilst developing C programs.

Goodluck and Enjoy!!!
