# C Sandbox

Small projects I made using C on my spare time in order to better appreciate programming in C.

It is mostly focused on key fundamentals I learned during school and covers some material in textbook C Primer Plus (Sixth Edition) by Stephen Prata.

# Why does it matter?

How do you eat an elephant... One bite at a time

I believe by completing and solving these several micro projects (each of which highlight key fundamental areas in programming) the closer you would get to using your computer to create cool projects that you're probably wishing you could make right now (I know I am).

But in the meantime you'll need to understand C and how to access + augment your computational thinking abilities.

# Why does it matter?

This collection of micro projects highlight the following fundamentals in C programming language (not in any order):

1. Basic composition of a simple C program
2. Types
3. Calculations
4. Character Strings and formatted input/output
5. Operators, Expressions, and Statements
6. Structured programming control structures (sequential constructs, selection constructs, iterative constructs)
7. Arrays
8. Structs
9. Functions
10. Pointers
11. Input, Output, and library functions

# Contributing

Since I found creating and breaking down things to be the quickest way to learn. Feel free to use and update any projects in any way you like to learn the concepts.

Goodluck and Enjoy!!!
