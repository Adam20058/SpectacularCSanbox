Ever heard of astrophysicist extraordinaire Carl Sagan, you know the host of the most awesome tv show "Cosmos". In his science fiction novel "Contact" he describes the prime to be one of the fundamental building blocks of all numbers.

Insects such as Cicadas time their life cycles by them.

Oh boy, well I would like to inform you they play an important role in our world, infact you're using prime numbers in your every day lives.

They play a fundamental role in computing specifically in security and encryption.

Ever use a credit card or debit card on Amazon. Well if you do, you should know prime numbers play an important role in encryption and decryption of the transaction process between you and the merchant your buying from.

In summary prime numbers are awesome and you should definitely watch "Cosmos".
